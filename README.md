### Description

As the name suggest, this is the famous, Yatzy, a game which is pretty easy to learn and play. In this application, i've included numerous functionalities; this include network-support with chat, a dynamic and very elaborative support of game-type (allowing users to make their own "levels" or variants of the game - Maxi-Yatzy and Normal Yatzy are included), plus a language skin. I've also managed to add support for plugins.
 
### More Info
 
Of some strange reason, the code seem to crash at closure on certain machines. I've tried to locate the problem, and it may be related to the mainfest-file. Removing that file might fix the problem.
